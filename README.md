# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

A machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world dataset from Kaggle. The project applies data preprocessing, class imbalance handling, and classification models to achieve meaningful fraud detection, with scope for further model tuning.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a serious issue impacting the financial industry. This project attempts to build a reliable model that can identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Contains anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`) and two columns: `Amount` and `Class` (0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🧪 Steps Involved
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values and anomalies.
2. **Handling Imbalanced Data**  
   - Used techniques like undersampling/oversampling (SMOTE).
3. **Model Building**  
   - Trained classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Used metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.
5. **Tuning (In Progress)**  
   - Hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods being explored to improve results.

## 📊 Results
- Achieved promising accuracy with good precision and recall on the minority (fraud) class.
- Still under tuning to reduce false positives and improve generalization.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Implement more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Deploy model via a simple web interface
- Real-time fraud detection simulation

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical approach to handling imbalanced classification problems in fraud detection and lays the foundation for production-ready ML systems.
